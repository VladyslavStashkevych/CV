# About me
I am student at Ukrainian National University "Lviv Polytechnic". I am currently learning C# and related to it frameworks(ASP.NET Core, EF Core). I also have some experience using databases, especially MS SQL. There will be my present/future projects below.

In this project there is "My borrowed Items" page which displays the list of three different variables: "ItemName", "Borrower" and "Lender". You can add new item to that list by clicking "Create new item" button. Aslo there is "My Expenses" page which is modified version of "My borrowed Items". Here you can delete or edit information ny clicking "Delete" or "Edit" buttons. Also, when creating new item in expenses list, there is a validation for empty box (When user didn't enter anything in box) and for not negative numbers (only numbers in range from 0 to "double.MaxValue" are allowed). Also "Cost" only displays in 0.00 format.
